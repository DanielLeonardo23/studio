## Core Features:

- Image Upload: User uploads an image of a food item or dish.
- Food Recognition: Leverage Google Vision API to automatically recognize the food item in the image.
- Nutrient Estimation: Employ Gemini AI as a tool, sending the image and labels, to intelligently estimate nutritional values (calories, protein, fats, water) per standard serving.
- Display Nutrients: Display the estimated nutritional information to the user.
- Input Grams Consumed: Allow the user to input the actual grams consumed.
- Recalculate Values: Recalculate and display the total nutritional values based on the user-inputted grams.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#90EE90) to represent health and nutrition, referencing vegetables, plants and the natural world. The green should connote 'clean eating'.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0), providing a clean and fresh backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft yellow (#FAFAD2), analogous to green, to highlight key information and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern and neutral appearance, providing readability and a clean aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clean, and recognizable icons to represent different nutrients and food categories. Icons should complement the overall minimalistic design.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for image input, food recognition, nutrient display, and gram input. Prioritize a user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as a loading animation while the AI is processing the image and calculating nutrients, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
